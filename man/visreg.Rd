\arguments{
\item{fit}{The fitted model object you wish to visualize.  Any object with
'predict' and 'model.frame' methods are supported, including lm, glm, gam,
rlm, coxph, and many more.}

\item{xvar}{Character string specifying the variable to be put on the x-axis
of your plot.  Both continuous variables and factors are supported.}

\item{by}{(Optional) A variable allowing you to divide your plot into
cross-sections based on levels of the \code{by} variable; particularly
useful for visualizing models with interactions.  Supplied as a character
string.  Uses the lattice package.  Both continuous variables and factors
are supported.}

\item{breaks}{If a continuous variable is used for the \code{by} option, the
\code{breaks} argument controls the values at which the cross-sections are
taken. By default, cross-sections are taken at the 10th, 50th, and 90th
quantiles.  If \code{breaks} is a single number, it specifies the number of
breaks.  If \code{breaks} is a vector of numbers, it specifies the values at
which the cross-sections are to be taken.  Each partial residuals appears
exactly once in the plot, in the panel it is closest to.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to be produced.  The following options are
supported: \itemize{ \item If 'conditional' is selected, the plot returned
shows the value of the variable on the x-axis and the change in response on
the y-axis, holding all other variables constant (by default, median for
numeric variables and most common category for factors).  \item If
'contrast' is selected, the plot returned shows the effect on the expected
value of the response by moving the x variable away from a reference point
on the x-axis (for numeric variables, this is taken to be the mean).  } For
more details, see references.}

\item{data}{The data frame used to fit the model.  Typically, visreg() can
figure out where the data is, so it is not necessary to provide this.  In
some cases, however, the data set cannot be located and must be supplied
explicitly.}

\item{trans}{(Optional) A function specifying a transformation for the
vertical axis.}

\item{scale}{By default, the model is plotted on the scale of the linear
predictor.  If \code{scale='response'} for a glm, the inverse link function
will be applied so that the model is plotted on the scale of the original
response.}

\item{xtrans}{(Optional) A function specifying a transformation for the
horizontal axis.  Note that, for model terms such as \code{log(x)}, visreg
automatically plots on the original axis (see examples).}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level (1-coverage) for the confidence band displayed in
the plot (default: 0.05).}

\item{nn}{Controls the smoothness of the line and confidence band.
Increasing this number will add to the computational burden, but produce a
smoother plot (default: 101).}

\item{cond}{Named list specifying conditional values of other explanatory
variables. By default, conditional plots in visreg are constructed by
filling in other explanatory variables with the median (for numeric
variables) or most common category (for factors), but this can be overridden
by specifying their values using \code{cond} (see examples).}

\item{jitter}{Adds a small amount of noise to \code{xvar}.  Potentially
useful if many observations have exactly the same value.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{collapse}{If the \code{predict} method for \code{fit} returns a
matrix, should this be returns as multiple visreg objects bound together as
a list (\code{collapse=FALSE}) or collapsed down to a single \code{visreg}
object (\code{collapse=TRUE}).}

\item{plot}{Send the calculations to \code{\link{plot.visreg}}?  Default is
TRUE.}

\item{\dots}{Graphical parameters (e.g., \code{ylab}) can be passed to the
function to customize the plots.  If \code{by=TRUE}, lattice parameters can
be passed, such as layout (see examples below).}
}
\value{
A \code{visreg} or \code{visregList} object (which is simply a list
of \code{visreg} objects).  A \code{visreg} object has three components:
\item{fit}{A data frame with \code{nn} rows containing the fit of the model
as \code{xvar} varies, along with lower and upper confidence bounds (named
\code{visregFit}, \code{visregLwr}, and \code{visregUpr}, respectively). The
fitted matrix of coefficients.} \item{res}{A data frame with \code{n} rows,
where \code{n} is the number of observations in the original data set used
to model.  This frame contains information about the residuals, named
\code{visregReg} and \code{visregPos}; the latter records whether the
residual was positive or negative.} \item{meta}{Contains meta-information
needed to construct plots, such as the name of the x and y variables,
whether there were any \code{by} variables, etc.}
}
\description{
A function for visualizing regression models quickly and easily. Default
plots contain a confidence band, prediction line, and partial residuals.
Factors, transformations, conditioning, interactions, and a variety of other
options are supported.  The \code{visreg} function performs the calculations
and, if \code{plot=TRUE} (the default), these calculations are passed to
\code{plot.visreg} for plotting.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{plot.visreg}} for plotting options, such as changing the
appearance of points, lines, confidence bands, etc.

# --- Linear models ----------------------------------------

## Basic
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp, data=airquality)
visreg(fit, "Wind", type="contrast")

birthwt$race <- factor(birthwt$race, labels=c("White","Black","Other"))
birthwt$smoke <- factor(birthwt$smoke, labels=c("Nonsmoker","Smoker"))

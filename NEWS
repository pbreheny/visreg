* Minor change
** Substantial change
*** Major change

1.0-1
      *  Fixed bug with formatting names for locfit objects
      *  Fixed bug with visregFactorPanel when partial=FALSE
      *  Changed default for ylabels to las=1 (always horizontal) 
      	 (Thank you to Doug Bates for this advice)

1.0-0
      *** Submitted to CRAN
      ** Improved support for effect plots:
	  - extensive revision to implementation
      	  - 'x' can now be categorical
	  - interactions/conditioning allowed
      ** Improved support for visreg2d
          - Interface/options consistent with visreg 
	  - Internal refactoring to share code between visreg and visreg2d
	  - Should work now with glm/rlm/gam/etc., although I haven't
	    tested all of these
      *  Fixed bug in 'ask' behavior when multple plots created
      *  Changed default (effect/conditional) for coxph models and
          fixed bug that occurred for coxph effect plots
      *  Default 'ylim' now depends on 'partial' argument
      *  Removed 'fill' option; always median fill from now on
      *  Patched get_all_vars bug when variables are in environment
          rather than data frame
      *  Added option to display panel strip names T/F
      *  Added some padding to xlim/ylim for lattice plots
      *  Default for 'ylab' changed: Delta added for effect plot
      *  Improved support for gam/locfit models

0.4-0
      ** Substantial refactoring of visreg:
      	  - new setupCond function to handle setting up of cond when
      	    'by' variables are present
	  - new functions visregPlot and visregLatticePlot to
            separate work done by the two types of plots ('by' present
            or absent)
	  - new function getXY for code that visregPlot and
            visregLatticePlot share
      *  Internal changes to handling of whitespace when 'x' is a factor
      *  Default for 'ylab' changed to always be name of response
          variable; virtually impossible in the presense of
          transformations, link functions, etc., to automatically
          choose an appropriate name
      *  Plotting options now pass to lattice correctly
      *  ylim for lattice plots fixed
      *  xtrans for lattice fixed
      *  Changed manner in which cross-sections are taken when 'by' is
          numeric; number of observations in each cross-section is now
          more even

0.3-0
      *  Reorganized frame construction again, using 'get_all_vars';
          now works with missing data and various other strange
          situations where f(x) is in the model but x isn't
      *  Added 'jitter' option
      *  Improved handling of trellis parameters

0.2-0
      ** Added by argument to support interactions (still buggy)
      *  visreg() now returns 'x' and 'y' invisibly
      *  Reorganized frame construction, using 'extract.frame' to
          reduce redundancy
      *  Modified default behavior of CI widths to make compatible with
          coxph models
      *  Resolved type/type2 conflict in visreg2d with 'plot.type' option
      *  Added 'scale' option for GLMs
      *  Added documentation (not finished)

0.1-0
      ** Added glm suport
      ** Added factor support in 1d version
      ** Added "terms" option for 2d plots
      ** Added 'cond' option for setting specific predictor variables
          for both versions (1d and 2d)
      ** The most common instance of each factor is chosen by default
          if the model includes factors
      *  Fixed bug for transformations for 2d plots
      *  Fixed bug that occurs when model is fit without supplying a
          data frame (i.e., when all variables are in the global
          environment)
      *  Fixed bug that occurs when a variable is class 'logical'
      *  Added 'partial' and 'xtrans' options

0.0-3
      *  Added 'trans' option for transforming response variable,
          axes still need changing when option is used, the centerFrame
          function is causing a problem when a transformed variable is
          used in the model
      ** Changed internal data frame evaluation, allowing the ability
          to lookup variables in the original data frame when
          constructing derived variables
          NOTE: Doing so rendered fillX obsolete and resulted in
                substantial changes to fillFrame, centerFrame, and
                setupD
          NOTE: This issue still causes an error if the variable is
                located in the global environment instead of the data
                frame; I see no easy way to resolve this error.

0.0-2
      *  Added fill='median' option

0.0-1 
      ** Added 'type' option to visreg, allowing both conditional and
          term plots
      *  Changed default y label in visreg
      *  Added fill='zero' option

0.0-0 
      *** Package infrastructure established
      **  visreg.R, visreg2d.R: Polynomial terms handled correctly
